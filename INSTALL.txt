Python module build instructions
================================

To avoid shared library mismatches, the Python module builds with an rpath
and ships the library inside the package.

Unless you are a distributor with tight control over the system libraries,
it is not recommended to install the library.


Build all
---------

# Build libndtypes and the module (libndtypes is copied into the package)
python3 setup.py build

# Test
python3 setup.py test

# Install
python3 setup.py install

# Clean libndtypes and the module
python3 setup.py distclean


Build the module only (for developing)
--------------------------------------

First, build libndtypes as above. This also copies the shared library into
the package.  Then, to avoid rebuilding the library repeatedly, use:

# Build the module
python3 setup.py module

# Clean the module
python3 setup.py clean


Alternative install (for developing)
------------------------------------

# Install the package into a local directory using a relative path.
# The following line installs the package into directory 'foo' outside
# the ndtypes directory. This is mainly useful for developing xnd or
# gufuncs.
python3 setup.py install --local=../foo
